1. What do you mean by collisions in a hash table? Explain the ways to avoid it.,"Hash table collisions are typically caused when two keys have the same index. Collisions, thus, result in a problem because two elements cannot share the same slot in an array. The following methods can be used to avoid such hash collisions:Separate chaining technique:This method involves storing numerous items hashing to a common slot using the data structure.Open addressing technique:This technique locates unfilled slots and stores the item in the first unfilled slot it finds.

Datasets can be validated in many ways. Methods of data validation commonly used by Data Analysts include:Field Level Validation: This method validates data as and when it is entered into the field. The errors can be corrected as you go.Form Level Validation: This type of validation is performed after the user submits the form. A data entry form is checked at once, every field is validated, and highlights the errors (if present) so that the user can fix them.Data Saving Validation: This technique validates data when a file or database record is saved. The process is commonly employed when several data entry forms must be validated.Search Criteria Validation: It effectively validates the user's search criteria in order to provide the user with accurate and related results. Its main purpose is to ensure that the search results returned by a user's query are highly relevant.",data_analysis

Explain Collaborative Filtering.Based on user behavioral data, collaborative filtering (CF) creates a recommendation system. By analyzing data from other users and their interactions with the system, it filters out information. This method assumes that people who agree in their evaluation of particular items will likely agree again in the future. Collaborative filtering has three major components: users- items- interests.Example:Collaborative filtering can be seen, for instance, on online shopping sites when you see phrases such as ""recommended for you??4. What do you mean by Time Series Analysis? Where is it used?In the field of Time Series Analysis (TSA), a sequence of data points is analyzed over an interval of time. Instead of just recording the data points intermittently or randomly, analysts record data points at regular intervals over a period of time in the TSA. It can be done in two different ways: in the frequency and time domains. As TSA has a broad scope of application, it can be used in a variety of fields. TSA plays a vital role in the following places:StatisticsSignal processingEconometricsWeather forecastingEarthquake predictionAstronomyApplied science5. What do you mean by clustering algorithms? Write different properties of clustering algorithms?Clustering is the process of categorizing data into groups and clusters. In a dataset, it identifies similar data groups. It is the technique of grouping a set of objects so that the objects within the same cluster are similar to one another rather than to those located in other clusters. When implemented, the clustering algorithm possesses the following properties:Flat or hierarchicalHard or SoftIterativeDisjunctive6. What is a Pivot table? Write its usage.One of the basic tools for data analysis is the Pivot Table. With this feature, you can quickly summarize large datasets in Microsoft Excel. Using it, we can turn columns into rows and rows into columns. Furthermore, it permits grouping by any field (column) and applying advanced calculations to them. It is an extremely easy-to-use program since you just drag and drop rows/columns headers to build a report. Pivot tables consist of four different sections:Value Area:This is where values are reported.Row Area:The row areas are the headings to the left of the values.Column Area:The headings above the values area make up the column area.Filter Area:Using this filter you may drill down in the data set.7. What do you mean by univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis?Univariate Analysis:The word uni means only one and variate means variable, so a univariate analysis has only one dependable variable. Among the three analyses, this is the simplest as the variables involved are only one.Example:A simple example of univariate data could be height as shown below:Bivariate Analysis:The word Bi means two and variate mean variables, so a bivariate analysis has two variables. It examines the causes of the two variables and the relationship between them. It is possible that these variables are dependent on or independent of each other.Example:A simple example of bivariate data could be temperature and ice cream sales in the summer season.Multivariate Analysis:In situations where more than two variables are to be analyzed simultaneously, multivariate analysis is necessary. It is similar to bivariate analysis, except that there are more variables involved.8. Explain Hierarchical clustering.This algorithm group objects into clusters based on similarities, and it is also called hierarchical cluster analysis. When hierarchical clustering is performed, we obtain a set of clusters that differ from each other.This clustering technique can be divided into two types:Agglomerative Clustering (which uses bottom-up strategy to decompose clusters)Divisive Clustering (which uses a top-down strategy to decompose clusters)9. Name some popular tools used in big data.In order to handle Big Data, multiple tools are used. There are a few popular ones as follows:HadoopSparkScalaHiveFlumeMahout, etc.10. What do you mean by logistic regression?Logistic Regression is basically a mathematical model that can be used to study datasets with one or more independent variables that determine a particular outcome. By studying the relationship between multiple independent variables, the model predicts a dependent data variable.11. What do you mean by the K-means algorithm?One of the most famous partitioning methods is K-mean. With this unsupervised learning algorithm, the unlabeled data is grouped in clusters. Here, 'k' indicates the number of clusters. It tries to keep each cluster separated from the other. Since it is an unsupervised model, there will be no labels for the clusters to work with.12. Write the difference between variance and covariance.Variance: In statistics, variance is defined as the deviation of a data set from its mean value or average value. When the variances are greater, the numbers in the data set are farther from the mean. When the variances are smaller, the numbers are nearer the mean. Variance is calculated as follows:Here, X represents an individual data point, U represents the average of multiple data points, and N represents the total number of data points.Covariance: Covariance is another common concept in statistics, like variance. In statistics, covariance is a measure of how two random variables change when compared with each other. Covariance is calculated as follows:Here, X represents the independent variable, Y represents the dependent variable, x-bar represents the mean of the X, y-bar represents the mean of the Y, and N represents the total number of data points in the sample.13. What are the advantages of using version control?Also known as source control, version control is the mechanism for configuring software. Records, files, datasets, or documents can be managed with this. Version control has the following advantages:Analysis of the deletions, editing, and creation of datasets since the original copy can be done with version control.Software development becomes clearer with this method.It helps distinguish different versions of the document from one another. Thus, the latest version can be easily identified.There's a complete history of project files maintained by it which comes in handy if ever there's a failure of the central server.Securely storing and maintaining multiple versions and variants of code files is easy with this tool.Using it, you can view the changes made to different files.14. Explain N-gramN-gram, known as the probabilistic language model, is defined as a connected sequence of n items in a given text or speech. ?It is basically composed of adjacent words or letters of length n that were present in the source text. In simple words, it is a way to predict the next item in a sequence, as in (n-1).15. Mention some of the statistical techniques that are used by Data analysts.Performing data analysis requires the use of many different statistical techniques. Some important ones are as follows:Markov processCluster analysisImputation techniquesBayesian methodologiesRank statistics16. What's the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse?The storage of data is a big deal. Companies that use big data have been in the news a lot lately, as they try to maximize its potential. Data storage is usually handled by traditional databases for the layperson. For storing, managing, and analyzing big data, companies use data warehouses and data lakes.Data Warehouse:This is considered an ideal place to store all the data you gather from many sources. A data warehouse is a centralized repository of data where data from operational systems and other sources are stored. It is a standard tool for integrating data across the team- or department-silos in mid-and large-sized companies. It collects and manages data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. Data warehouses can be of the following types:Enterprise data warehouse (EDW): Provides decision support for the entire organization.Operational Data Store (ODS): Has functionality such as reporting sales data or employee data.Data Lake:Data lakes are basically large storage device that stores raw data in their original format until they are needed. with its large amount of data, analytical performance and native integration are improved. It exploits data warehouses' biggest weakness: their incapacity to be flexible. In this, neither planning nor knowledge of data analysis is required; the analysis is assumed to happen later, on-demand.Conclusion:The purpose of Data Analysis is to transform data to discover valuable information that can be used for making decisions. The use of data analytics is crucial in many industries for various purposes, hence, the demand for Data Analysts is therefore high around the world.

What's the difference between a data lake and a data warehouse?The storage of data is a big deal. Companies that use big data have been in the news a lot lately, as they try to maximize its potential. Data storage is usually handled by traditional databases for the layperson. For storing, managing, and analyzing big data, companies use data warehouses and data lakes.Data Warehouse:This is considered an ideal place to store all the data you gather from many sources. A data warehouse is a centralized repository of data where data from operational systems and other sources are stored. It is a standard tool for integrating data across the team- or department-silos in mid-and large-sized companies. It collects and manages data from varied sources to provide meaningful business insights. Data warehouses can be of the following types:Enterprise data warehouse (EDW): Provides decision support for the entire organization.Operational Data Store (ODS): Has functionality such as reporting sales data or employee data.Data Lake:Data lakes are basically large storage device that stores raw data in their original format until they are needed. with its large amount of data, analytical performance and native integration are improved. It exploits data warehouses' biggest weakness: their incapacity to be flexible. In this, neither planning nor knowledge of data analysis is required; the analysis is assumed to happen later, on-demand.Conclusion:The purpose of Data Analysis is to transform data to discover valuable information that can be used for making decisions. The use of data analytics is crucial in many industries for various purposes, hence, the demand for Data Analysts is therefore high around the world.

2. What do you mean by Lemmatization in NLP?,"The method of mapping all the various forms of a word to its base word (also called ?lemma?) is known as Lemmatization. Although this may appear close to the definition of stemming, these are actually different. For instance, the word ?better,? after stemming, remains the same. However, upon lemmatization, this should become ?good,?. Lemmatization needs greater linguistic knowledge. Modelling and developing efficient lemmatizers still remains an open problem in NLP research.The application of a lemmatizer based on WordNet from NLTK is shown in the code snippet below:from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordnetLemmatizer()

print(lemmatizer.lemmatize(""better"", pos=""a"")) #a is for adjective 3. What do you mean by Stemming in NLP?When we remove the suffixes from a word so that the word is reduced to its base form, this process is called stemming. When the word is reduced to its base form, all the different variants of that word can be represented by the same form (e.g., ?bird? and ?birds? are both reduced to ?bird?).We can do this by using a fixed set of rules. For instance: ?if a word ends in ?-es,? we can remove the ?-es?).Even though these rules might not really make sense as a linguistically correct base form, stemming is usually carried out to match user queries in search engines to relevant documents. And in text classification, is done to reduce the feature space to train our machine learning (ML) models.The code snippet given below depicts the way to use a well known NLP algorithm for stemming called Porter Stemmer using NLTK:from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
stemmer = PorterStemmer()
word1, word2 = ""bikes"", ""revolution"" 
print(stemmer.stem(word1), stemmer.stem(word2))This gives ?bike? as the stemmed version for ?bikes,? but ?revolut? as the stemmed form of ?revolution,? even though the latter is not linguistically correct. Even if this might not affect the performance of the search engine, a derivation of the correct linguistic form becomes useful in some other cases. This can be done by another process that is closer to stemming, known as lemmatization.",nlp

How do Conversational Agents work?The following NLP components are used in Conversational Agents:Speech Recognition and Synthesis:In the first stage, speech recognition helps convert speech signals to their phonemes, and are then transcribed as words.Natural Language Understanding (NLU):Here, the transcribed text from stage one is further analysed through AI techniques within the natural language understanding system. Certain NLP tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Text Classification, Language modelling, etc. come into play here.Dialog Management:Once the needed information from text is extracted, we move on to the stage of understanding the user?s intent. The user?s response can then be classified by using a text classification system as a pre-defined intent. This helps the conversational agent in figuring out what is actually being asked.Generating Response:Based on the above stages, the agent generates an appropriate response that is based on a semantic interpretation of the user?s intent.",nlp

Text Classification: Common NLP Tasks in order of Difficulty NLP Interview Questions for Experienced1. What do you mean by TF-IDF in Natural language Processing?TF-IDF also calledTerm Frequency-Inverse Document Frequencyhelps us get the importance of a particular word relative to other words in the corpus. It's a common scoring metric in information retrieval (IR) and summarization. TF-IDF converts words into vectors and adds semantic information, resulting in weighted unusual words that may be utilised in a variety of NLP applications.2. What do you mean by perplexity in NLP?It's a statistic for evaluating the effectiveness of language models. It is described mathematically as a function of the likelihood that the language model describes a test sample. The perplexity of a test sample X = x1, x2, x3,....,xn is given by,PP(X)=P(x1,x2,?,xN)-1NThe total number of word tokens is N.The more perplexing the situation, the less information the language model conveys.ConclusionOne of the most important reasons for NLP is that it allows computers to converse with people in natural language. Other language-related activities are also scaled. Computers can now hear, analyse, quantify, and identify which parts of speech are significant thanks to Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP has a wide range of applications, including chatbots, sentiment analysis, and market intelligence. Since its introduction, NLP has grown in popularity. Today, devices like Amazon's Alexa are extensively used all over the world. And, for businesses, business intelligence and consumer monitoring are quickly gaining traction and will soon rule the industry.References and Resources:Natural Language Processing with Python ?

What is the meaning of N-gram in NLP?Text N-grams are commonly used in text mining and natural language processing. They're essentially a collection of co-occurring words within a specific frame, and when computing the n-grams, you usually advance one word (although you can move X words forward in more advanced scenarios).4. What is the meaning of Pragmatic Analysis in NLP?Pragmatic Analysis is concerned with outside word knowledge, which refers to information that is not contained in the documents and/or questions. The many parts of the language that require real-world knowledge are derived from a pragmatics analysis that focuses on what was described and reinterpreted by what it truly meant.5. What do you mean by Masked language modelling?Masked language modelling is an NLP technique for extracting the output from a contaminated input. Learners can use this approach to master deep representations in downstream tasks. Using this NLP technique, you may predict a word based on the other words in the sentence.The following is the process for Masked language modelling:Our text is tokenized. We start with text tokenization, just as we would with transformers.Make a tensor of labels. We're using a labels tensor to calculate loss against ? and optimise towards ? as we train our model.Tokens in input ids are masked. We can mask a random selection of tokens now that we've produced a duplicate of input ids for labels.Make a loss calculation. We use our model to process the input ids and labels tensors and determine the loss between them.6. What do you mean by Autoencoders?A network that is used for learning a vector representation of the input in a compressed form, is called an autoencoder. It is a type of unsupervised learning since labels aren?t needed for the process. This is mainly used to learn the mapping function from the input. In order to make the mapping useful, the input is reconstructed from the vector representation. After training is complete, the vector representation that we get helps encode the input text as a dense vector. Autoencoders are generally used to make feature representations.In the figure below, the hidden layer depicts a compressed representation of the source data that captures its essence. The input representation is reconstructed by the output layer called the decoder.7. Explain the pipeline for Information extraction (IE) in NLP.In comparison to text classification, the typical pipeline for IE necessitates more fine-grained NLP processing. For example, we'd need to know the part-of-speech tags of words to identify named entities (people, organisations, etc.). We would require coreference resolution to connect various references to the same entity (e.g., Albert Einstein, Einstein, the scientist, he, etc.). It's worth noting that none of these stages are required for creating a text classification system. As a result, IE is a more NLP-intensive operation than text categorization. Not all steps in the pipeline are required for all IE jobs, as shown in the diagram, and the figure shows which IE tasks necessitate which degrees of analysis.Other than named entity recognition, all other IE tasks require deeper NLP pre-processing followed by models developed for those specific tasks. Key phrase extraction is the task that requires the least amount of NLP processing (some algorithms also do POS tagging before extracting key phrases), whereas all other IE tasks require deeper NLP pre-processing followed by models developed for those specific tasks. Standard evaluation sets are often used to assess IE tasks in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores. Because of the various levels of NLP pre-processing required, the accuracy of these processing steps has an impact on IE jobs. All of these factors should be considered when collecting relevant training data and, if necessary, training our own models for IE.8. What are some metrics on which NLP models are evaluated?The following are some metrics on which NLP models are evaluated:Accuracy:When the output variable is categorical or discrete, accuracy is used. It is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model compared to the total number of predictions made.Precision:Indicates how precise or exact the model's predictions are, i.e., how many positive (the class we care about) examples can the model correctly identify given all of them?Recall:Precision and recall are complementary. It measures how effectively the model can recall the positive class, i.e., how many of the positive predictions it generates are correct.F1 score:This metric combines precision and recall into a single metric that also represents the trade-off between accuracy and recall, i.e., completeness and exactness.(2 Precision Recall) / (Precision + Recall) is the formula for F1.AUC:As the prediction threshold is changed, the AUC captures the number of correct positive predictions versus the number of incorrect positive predictions.9. What is the difference between NLP and NLU?Natural Language Processing (NLP)Natural Language Understanding (NLU)NLP is a system that manages end-to-end conversations between computers and people at the same time.NLU aids in the solving of Artificial Intelligence's complex problems.Humans and machines are both involved in NLP.NLU allows machines to interpret unstructured inputs by transforming them into structured text.NLP focuses on interpreting language in its most literal sense, such as what was said.NLU, on the other hand, concentrates on extracting context and meaning, or what was meant.NLP can parse text-based on grammar, structure, typography, and point of view.It'll be NLU that helps the machine deduce the meaning behind the language content.10. What is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in NLP?Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI), also known as Latent Semantic Analysis, is a mathematical method for improving the accuracy of information retrieval. It aids in the discovery of hidden(latent) relationships between words (semantics) by generating a set of various concepts associated with the terms of a phrase in order to increase information comprehension. Singular value decomposition is the NLP technique utilised for this aim. It's best for working with small groups of static documents.11. What do you mean by Parts of Speech (POS) tagging in NLP?A Part-Of-Speech Tagger (POS Tagger) reads the text in a language and assigns parts of speech to each word (and other tokens), such as noun, verb, adjective, and so on.To label terms in text bodies, PoS taggers employ an algorithm. With tags like ""noun-plural"" or even more complicated labels, these taggers create more complex categories than those stated as basic PoS.12. What do you mean by a Bag of Words (BOW)?TheBag of Wordsmodel is a popular one that uses word frequency or occurrences to train a classifier. This methodology generates a matrix of occurrences for documents or phrases, regardless of their grammatical structure or word order.A bag-of-words is a text representation that describes the frequency with which words appear in a document. It entails two steps:A list of terms that are well-known.A metric for determining the existence of well-known terms.Because any information about the sequence or structure of words in the document is deleted, it is referred to as a ""bag"" of words. The model simply cares about whether or not recognised terms appear in the document, not where they appear.13. Explain how parsing is done in NLP.Parsing is the process of identifying and understanding a text's syntactic structure. It is accomplished by examining the text's constituent pieces. The machine parses each word one by one, then two by two, three by three, and so on. It's a unigram when the system parses the text one word at a time. A bigram is a text that is parsed two words at a time. When the machine parses three words at a time, the set of words is called atrigram.The following points will help us comprehend the importance of parsing in NLP:Any syntax errors are reported by the parser.It aids in the recovery of often occurring errors so that the remainder of the programme can be processed.A parser is used to generate the parse tree.The parser is used to construct a symbol table, which is crucial in NLP.In addition, a Parser is utilised to generate intermediate representations (IR).14. What are the steps to follow when building a text classification system?When creating a text classification system, the following steps are usually followed:Gather or develop a labelled dataset that is appropriate for the purpose.Decide on an evaluation metric after splitting the dataset into two (training and test) or three parts: training, validation (i.e., development), and test sets (s).Convert unprocessed text into feature vectors.Utilize the feature vectors and labels from the training set to train a classifier.Benchmark the model's performance on the test set using the evaluation metric(s) from Step 2.Deploy the model and track its performance to serve a real-world use case.15. What is an ensemble method in NLP?An ensemble approach is a methodology that derives an output or makes predictions by combining numerous independent similar or distinct models/weak learners. An ensemble can also be created by combining various models such as random forest, SVM, and logistic regression.Bias, variance, and noise, as we all know, have a negative impact on the mistakes and predictions of any machine learning model. Ensemble approaches are employed to overcome these drawbacks.16. Explain the concept of Feature Engineering.After a variety of pre-processing procedures and their applications, we need a way to input the pre-processed text into an NLP algorithm later when we employ ML methods to complete our modelling step. The set of strategies that will achieve this goal is referred to as feature engineering. Feature extraction is another name for it. The purpose of feature engineering is to convert the text's qualities into a numeric vector that NLP algorithms can understand. This stage is called ""text representation"".17. What is the meaning of Text Normalization in NLP?Consider a situation in which we?re operating with a set of social media posts to find information events. Social media textual content may be very exceptional from the language we?d see in, say, newspapers. A phrase may be spelt in multiple ways, such as in shortened forms, (for instance, with and without hyphens), names are usually in lowercase, and so on. When we're developing NLP tools to work with such kinds of data, it?s beneficial to attain a canonical representation of textual content that captures these kinds of variations into one representation. This is referred to as text normalization.Converting all text to lowercase or uppercase, converting digits to text (e.g., 7 to seven), expanding abbreviations, and so on are some frequent text normalisation stages.

Explain how parsing is done in NLP.Parsing is the process of identifying and understanding a text's syntactic structure. It is accomplished by examining the text's constituent pieces. The machine parses each word one by one, then two by two, three by three, and so on. It's a unigram when the system parses the text one word at a time. A bigram is a text that is parsed two words at a time. When the machine parses three words at a time, the set of words is called atrigram.The following points will help us comprehend the importance of parsing in NLP:Any syntax errors are reported by the parser.It aids in the recovery of often occurring errors so that the remainder of the programme can be processed.A parser is used to generate the parse tree.The parser is used to construct a symbol table, which is crucial in NLP.In addition, a Parser is utilised to generate intermediate representations (IR).",nlp

What is the meaning of Text Normalization in NLP?Consider a situation in which we?re operating with a set of social media posts to find information events. Social media textual content may be very exceptional from the language we?d see in, say, newspapers. A phrase may be spelt in multiple ways, such as in shortened forms, (for instance, with and without hyphens), names are usually in lowercase, and so on. When we're developing NLP tools to work with such kinds of data, it?s beneficial to attain a canonical representation of textual content that captures these kinds of variations into one representation. This is referred to as text normalization.Converting all text to lowercase or uppercase, converting digits to text (e.g., 7 to seven), expanding abbreviations, and so on are some frequent text normalisation stages.",nlp

2. List the advantages of HTTP/2 over HTTP 1.1.,"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of standard protocols allowing internet users to exchange website knowledge on WWW (World Wide Web). HTTP has gone through four iterations since it was introduced in 1991 i.e., HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2.0. In 2015, HTTP/2 was released as a major revision to HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2.0 has the following advantages over HTTP/1.1:Increased performance:It was designed specifically to speed up page loading and reduce round-trip time (RTT) for resource-intensive websites.Handle multiple resources:With HTTP 1.1, the web pages were manageable simply by using HTML markups and images. But with HTTP 2.0, there are now multiple resources available for web pages, including images, fonts, scripts, and more. HTTP 1.1 was not designed to handle such a large amount of resources today.Multiplexing:Multiplexing is fully implemented in HTTP/2. It means that multiple requests are sent between browsers and servers simultaneously over a single TCP connection. Consequently, several elements of a web page can be delivered via a single TCP connection. As a result, the HTTP/1.1 head-of-line blocking problem is resolved, in which a packet at the front of the line blocks the transmission of other packets.Header Compression:HTTP 2.0 has the ability to compress HTTP headers to reduce overhead. When HTML headers on web pages are compressed, they can be sent between the browser and server in one trip, over a single TCP connection.Server push:HTTP/2 servers are able to push resources into a browser's cache even before they are requested. By doing this, browsers can display content without requiring additional requests.Binary protocols:HTTP/2 use binary protocols, not textual. HTML/2's binary protocols consume less bandwidth, can be parsed more efficiently, and are less error-prone compared to HTTP/1.1's textual protocols. HTTP/2.0 has the following advantages over HTTP/1.1: Increased performance:It was designed specifically to speed up page loading and reduce round-trip time (RTT) for resource-intensive websites.Handle multiple resources:With HTTP 1.1, the web pages were manageable simply by using HTML markups and images.

Explain CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) and Write its Importance.CORS stands for Cross-origin resource sharing. It is basically defined as a browser mechanism that enables web pages from one domain to have controlled access to resources that are located at different domains (cross-domain request). In other words, it allows scripts running on a browser client to interact with and access resources from other origins. It provides and extends flexibility to the SOP (Same-Origin Policy). A same-origin policy restricts a website's ability to access resources outside its source domain. For example, if a JavaScript app wanted to call an API (Application Programming Interface) running on another domain, it would be blocked and prevented from doing so because of the SOP. Due to restrictions caused by the same-origin policy, CORS was introduced.When a website's CORS policy is set up poorly, it also poses the risk of cross-domain attacks. As such, it cannot prevent cross-origin attacks such as ?CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).",web

4. What do you mean by ETag (Entity Tag) and how does it work?,"The ETag (entity tag) is a part of the HTTP protocol. This is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides to validate Web caches, which allows conditional requests to be made from a browser to resources. Moreover, Etags make sure that simultaneous updates of the same resource don't overwrite each other (mid-air collisions).ETags are opaque identifiers assigned by a server to a specific version of a resource found at a specific URL. Every time the resource representation at that URL changes, an entirely new ETag is assigned. As such, ETags can be compared in the same way as fingerprints and determine if two representations of a resource are identical.Syntax:ETag: W/""<etag_value>""ETag: ""<etag_value>"" The ETag (entity tag) is a part of the HTTP protocol.

Explain HTML5 Web storage.HTML5 has many great features, including Web Storage, which is sometimes referred to as DOM storage (Document Object Model Storage). Web applications can use Web Storage to store data locally in the browser on the user/client?s side. Data is stored in the form of a key/value pair in the user's browser. Using web storage to store data is similar to using cookies, but web storage is faster and more convenient. Web Storage should never be used to store sensitive data. It isn't ""more secure"" than cookies since it isn't transmitted over the wire and isn't encrypted.Types of Web Storage:As outlined below, there are two types of web storage with different scopes and lifespans:Local Storage:This storage uses Windows.localStorage object that stores data with no expiration date. Once stored in local storage, the data will remain available even after the user's browser is closed and reopened.Session Storage:This storage uses the Windows.sessionStorage object that stores data for one or single session only.

Explain DOM (Document Object Model)?DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is basically a cross-platform, language-independent API (Application Programming Interface) for XML (Extensible Markup Language) and HTML documents. To put it simply, DOM describes the logical structure of documents and how one can access and manipulate them. For example, here is an HTML document that illustrates the DOM hierarchy.These documents are usually treated as a tree structure in which every node is an object that represents a specific part of the document. In a tree, each branch ends with a node, and each node contains objects. The DOM represents the webpage in a hierarchical structure in order for programmers and users to navigate it more easily.",web

CDNs are geographically distributed groups of servers that deliver Internet content quickly. To provide end-users with fast, secure media delivery and web content, the servers are dispersed across many physical and network locations. Using CDNs can significantly reduce load times since they deliver files at higher bandwidth from servers located closer to your visitors than your own web server.For faster access and better performance, web programmers and developers can leverage CDNs to host theirjQuery Libraries. Microsoft and Google have already put jQuery on their CDNs, so developers don't have to worry about that. Their only task now is to reference the hosted jQuery library.Google CDN<head>

The W3C strives to help the web reach its full potential and ensure its continuous development. It sets standards (protocols) for the WWW (World Wide Web) to allow for interoperability and cooperation between all stakeholders. It develops various protocols or standards as a means of growing the web.Characteristics of W3C:It develops and publishes web standards or protocols.Furthermore, it ensures the development and growth of the web.In addition, it sets the standards or protocols for web scripts, web applications, and other dynamic content.While designing web protocols, W3C adheres to the principles of modularity, simplicity, and extensibility.3. What do you mean by CSS Selectors? Name a Few.CSS selectorsare used by web designers to specify or select HTML elements they want to style. Following are a few of the most commonly used CSS selectors:ID Selector:It selects HTML elements using specific id attributes.Syntax:#idnameExample: Here is the CSS rule that will be applied to the HTML element having id=""para1"".#para1{text-align: left;color: blue;
}Class Selector:It selects HTML elements using specific class attributes.Syntax:.classnameExample: Here is the CSS rule that will be applied to the HTML element with class=""scaler""..scaler{text-align: left;color: blue;
}Child Selector or Combinator:It selects all HTML elements that are children of the specified element. In a child selector, there are two or more selectors separated by "">"".Syntax:selector1 > selector2Example: Here is a CSS rule that will be applied to HTML elements (<p>) that are children of a <div> element.div>p{background-color: blue;
}4. What are pseudo-classes?A pseudo-class is basically used to define or specify a special state of an HTML element. This can be used in conjunction with an existing CSS selector to add effects to elements based on their state. For instance, changing the style of an element when a user hovers over it or using different styles for visited and unvisited links. The pseudo-class gives you the ability to do all of this.Syntax:selector: pseudo-class{
    property: value;
}In CSS, there are many pseudo-classes, but the ones that are most frequently used are as follows::visited pseudo-class: Select the links that the user has already visited.:hover pseudo-class: A special effect can be added to an element when the mouse pointer is over it.:active pseudo-class: Select the element that becomes active when the user clicks on it.:focus pseudo-class: Select an element that is currently focused by the user.5. Why are media queries used in CSS?Media queries are used in CSS to create responsive web designs. This means that the way a web page appears varies from one system to another based on the screen or the media type. The media query can be used to apply different styles or change the appearance (and even the behaviour) of a site or an app depending on a user's device type or specific characteristics (like browser viewport width, height, screen resolution, etc.). The following can be checked using media queries:Dimensions (width and height) of the viewportDimensions (width and height) of the deviceOrientationResolution6. Explain long polling.Long polling is generally a web application development method that is used to push information or data from the server to the client as quickly as possible. Long-polling maintains the connection between client and server after a request has been made from the client to the server. The connection is maintained until information becomes available from the server and it is ready to send it to the client.? If the server receives a request from the client, it doesn't close the connection immediately; the connection is only closed when the server sends the data back to the client or when a timeout threshold is reached (connection timeout).7. State difference between Local Storage and Cookies.The differences between local storage and cookies are as follows:Local StorageCookiesLocal storage generally stores large amounts of data on the client's computer (client?s browser) as key-value pairs.Simply put, a cookie is a small text file containing information about a website, like a username or a password. When you visit a particular website, this website saves some information in your local system so that it can recognize you and display results according to your preferences.The client can only access local storage. It is impossible for a server to use local storage unless it deliberately makes a request to the server via GET or POST.Servers and clients are both able to read and write cookies.Local storage has a storage capacity of 5MB/10MB.Cookies have a storage capacity of 4KB.Local storage does not have an expiration date, so it must be manually removed.Cookies have an expiration date and cookie data is purged after a certain period of time.8. What is the purpose of Canvas in HTML?In simple terms, Canvas (<canvas> tag) is an HTML element that enables you to draw or create graphics on a web page using JavaScript. This is a new tag in HTML5. Canvas allows you to dynamically control graphics, images, and text on your web pages, adding a great deal of interactivity. You can create graphs, combine photos, and create animated elements using the CANVAS element.Syntax:<canvas id = ""script""> Contents... </canvas>Example:In this example, we have a simple *canvas> element that only has two specific attributes: width (set width of the canvas) and height (set height of the canvas), along with the HTML5 core attributes such as id, name, and class.<!DOCTYPEhtml><html><body><!-- canvas Tag starts here --><canvasid=""InterviewBit""width=""100""height=""100""style=""border:1px solid blue""></canvas><!-- canvas Tag ends here --></body></html>Or<!DOCTYPEHTML><html><head><style>#Interviewbit{border:1pxsolid blue;}</style></head><body><canvasid=""Interviewbit""width=""100""height=""100""></canvas></body></html>Output:9. What is the purpose of closures in JavaScript?In JavaScript, a closure is known as a JavaScript closure or JS closure. Closures allow you to access the scope (variables and parameters) of an outer function from an inner function. Every time a JavaScript function is created, a closure is created. JavaScript closures allow you to control which variables are and are not in scope in a given function, as well as which variables are shared among siblings within the same containing scope.10. What is an event loop in Node JS?Asynchronous programming in JavaScript is made possible by the event loop. With JS, all operations occur on a single thread, but we can create the illusion of multi-threading by using smart data structures. Event loop takes care of anything that's async using a queue and listener.So, when an async function has to be executed (or an I/O has to be performed), the main thread sends it to another thread, allowing v8 (Javascript engine) to continue running its code. The event loop consists of different phases with specific tasks like pending callbacks, close callbacks, timers, idle or prepare, poll, check, with different FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues.ConclusionIn an era of economic uncertainty, web development is one of the most promising careers to pursue. In spite of this, web developer interviews can be intimidating, and if you are unprepared, you will become overwhelmed and lose confidence. In order to be competitive, you must be able to have a competitive edge and skill sets that set you apart from the rest. To be successful, you must have a thorough understanding and hands-on experience with integrating new technologies, CSS3, HTML5 APIs, front-end scripting language libraries, and languages like JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc. Furthermore, you must be knowledgeable about configuring applications on web servers and databases, managing SEO keywords, browser compatibility and web security.Hope you found this article informative and helpful in clearing your doubts.

1. What do you mean by CDN (Content Delivery Network) in jQuery?,"CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs are geographically distributed groups of servers that deliver Internet content quickly. To provide end-users with fast, secure media delivery and web content, the servers are dispersed across many physical and network locations. Using CDNs can significantly reduce load times since they deliver files at higher bandwidth from servers located closer to your visitors than your own web server.For faster access and better performance, web programmers and developers can leverage CDNs to host theirjQuery Libraries. Microsoft and Google have already put jQuery on their CDNs, so developers don't have to worry about that. Their only task now is to reference the hosted jQuery library.Google CDN<head>

Why are media queries used in CSS?Media queries are used in CSS to create responsive web designs. This means that the way a web page appears varies from one system to another based on the screen or the media type. The media query can be used to apply different styles or change the appearance (and even the behaviour) of a site or an app depending on a user's device type or specific characteristics (like browser viewport width, height, screen resolution, etc.). The following can be checked using media queries:Dimensions (width and height) of the viewportDimensions (width and height) of the deviceOrientationResolution",web

Explain long polling.Long polling is generally a web application development method that is used to push information or data from the server to the client as quickly as possible. Long-polling maintains the connection between client and server after a request has been made from the client to the server. The connection is maintained until information becomes available from the server and it is ready to send it to the client.? If the server receives a request from the client, it doesn't close the connection immediately; the connection is only closed when the server sends the data back to the client or when a timeout threshold is reached (connection timeout).",web

11. Can you explain what AJAX is?,"AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) refers to a set of technologies used for developing web applications. The purpose of AJAX is to create better, faster, and more interactive web applications using these technologies such as XML, HTML/XHTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest etc. Through Ajax, web applications are able to send and receive data asynchronously from the server without hampering the display or behaviour of the existing site. Using AJAX, you can exchange information with a server and update portions of a webpage without having to reload the whole page. The term ""AJAX"" refers to a technique for creating dynamic, fast web pages. What is the best way to integrate different stylesheets into a website?Typically, it depends on how your site is laid out and how users interact with it. The most efficient way, however, would be to use just a single file called styles.css (or something similar). Combining them into a single document is preferable. Loading one file is easier for a client than loading five. In order to change the style, you simply open the styles.css file, scroll down to find the appropriate section, and modify the CSS. The sheet can be linked in your HTML as follows:<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""styles.css"">",web

How do you optimize the loading time of your web application as a Web Developer?As a Web Developer, here are the top hacks for reducing load time and optimizing your web application's loading times:Image compression and optimization:Using images on your website will improve the appearance and quality of your pages. However, larger images will also slow down the loading process. Compressing and optimizing images is one of the easiest ways to improve the speed of your site. The smaller your images' file sizes, the less weight they have, which, in turn, helps your pages load faster.Put JavaScript and CSS in external files:When JavaScript and CSS are embedded in HTML documents, they are downloaded each time the HTML document is loaded. As a result, this does not utilize browser caching, increasing the size of HTML documents. You should always place CSS and JavaScript in external files; this is best practice and makes maintaining your site easier.Reduce the number of redirects:A website with too many redirects will take a long time to load. HTTP request and response times are prolonged every time a page redirects. If you eliminate unnecessary redirects on your site, your page load time will be significantly reduced.CSS and JavaScript files should be loaded asynchronously:You have CSS and JavaScript files on your website that can be loaded synchronously or asynchronously. In synchronous loading, each file is loaded one at a time, in the order in which it appears on your web page. Asynchronous loading, on the other hand, allows multiple files to be loaded simultaneously, which can speed up the performance of a website. 'Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Your pages will load faster if you optimize how your files to load. In a similar vein, you can minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. You can reduce the size of files by eliminating unnecessary spaces, characters, comments, and other components. As a result, web pages will load faster with cleaner code.",web

As a Web Developer, here are the top hacks for reducing load time and optimizing your web application's loading times: Image compression and optimization:Using images on your website will improve the appearance and quality of your pages. Image compression and optimization:Using images on your website will improve the appearance and quality of your pages. The smaller your images' file sizes, the less weight they have, which, in turn, helps your pages load faster. Image compression and optimization: Put JavaScript and CSS in external files:When JavaScript and CSS are embedded in HTML documents, they are downloaded each time the HTML document is loaded. You should always place CSS and JavaScript in external files; this is best practice and makes maintaining your site easier. Put JavaScript and CSS in external files: Reduce the number of redirects:A website with too many redirects will take a long time to load. If you eliminate unnecessary redirects on your site, your page load time will be significantly reduced. Reduce the number of redirects: CSS and JavaScript files should be loaded asynchronously:You have CSS and JavaScript files on your website that can be loaded synchronously or asynchronously. ' CSS and JavaScript files should be loaded asynchronously: Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Your pages will load faster if you optimize how your files to load. Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 14.

Explain the term ?Scope? in JavaScript and write its different type.Managing the availability of variables or objects in an application is governed by the concept of scope. In JavaScript, there are two types of scope as follows:Global Scope:A variable having global scope can be accessed from anywhere in the program. These variables that are declared outside of any function can be accessed from any place in the program.Example:letscalerProgram =""DataScience""// code here can use scalerProgramfunctionmyScaler(){// code here can also use scalerProgram}Local Scope: Variables with a local scope can only be accessed within the same function in which they are declared. Whenever a variable is declared inside a function, it becomes local to the function. As soon as a function begins, local variables are created and deleted when the function is executed.Example:// code here can NOT use scalerProgramfunctionmyScaler(){letscalerProgram =""DataScience"";// code here CAN use scalerProgram}// code here can NOT use scalerProgram",web
